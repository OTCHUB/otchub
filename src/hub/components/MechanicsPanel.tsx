        <p className={p}>
          $HUB turns every OTC desk NFT into a yield-earning position. Activate a desk and it starts
          collecting a share of Protocol Revenue every reward round — funded entirely by protocol
          activity, never taken from other holders. A slice of that same revenue buys back and burns
          $HUB every round, permanently shrinking the supply that's left.

        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <li className={li}>
            Every desk NFT can be activated into one of four tiers. Activation is tied to the desk
            itself, not your wallet — sell the desk and the new owner keeps earning immediately, no
            re-activation needed.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Pay the Activation Cost in SOL, or in $OTC at a fixed 2.00x premium — $OTC payments go
            straight into the protocol's liquidity reserve rather than the reward pool.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Rewards start accruing the instant you activate — only reward rounds closed after that
            moment count, so there's no way to backdate earnings or dilute existing holders.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Upgrading to a higher tier later only costs the difference between your current and
            target tier — you never pay for the same step twice.

      <CollapsibleCard title="2. HOW DAILY REWARDS ARE PAID">
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <li className={li}>
            Protocol Revenue comes from six sources: desk activation fees, earnings from the
            treasury's own desks, the treasury's OTC trading profits, half of every discounted
            treasury desk sale, earnings from desks donated to the treasury, and trading fees from
            the $HUB liquidity pool.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Revenue collects continuously until it crosses the reward-round trigger (
            {fmtSol(config.minPotThresholdLamports)}) — rounds close purely on activity, never a
            fixed schedule, so a round can settle in seconds or take days.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            When a round closes, {fmtBp(config.burnPctBp, 0)} of it is set aside for buyback & burn,
            and the rest is split across every active desk in proportion to its tier — Market Makers
            earn the largest share, Traders the base share. No revenue is ever lost to rounding —
            any leftover simply rolls into the next round.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Claiming pays out every reward round you've earned since your last claim in a single
            transaction — there's no need to claim round by round.
          </li>

      <CollapsibleCard title="3. TREASURY-BOOSTED YIELD">
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <li className={li}>
            The protocol treasury buys desks on the open market whenever that's cheaper than minting
            a new one — so a growing treasury desk stack never dilutes existing holders. Purchases
            are capped at 10% of treasury SOL per desk and only target verified sellers.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Any holder can also donate a desk to the treasury without giving up ownership — they
            keep the right to withdraw it later, and can optionally route a share of its earnings
            back to themselves as a referral share ({fmtBp(config.consignorShareBp)} default).
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Every desk the treasury owns or holds for a donor earns rewards exactly like any other
            desk, and that income feeds straight back into the same reward pool everyone shares
            from. A bigger treasury desk stack means a bigger reward pool for every activated desk —{" "}
            {config.tierWeightsBp.map((w, i) => `${TIER_NAMES[i]} ${fmtWeight(w)}`).join(" / ")}—
            with zero dilution to any holder.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            Occasionally the treasury sells a desk back to the market at a 10% discount to manage
            its holdings: half the sale burns $HUB immediately, the other half tops up the reward
            pool. Donated desks are permanently excluded from ever being sold.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <CollapsibleCard title="4. BUYBACK, BURN & LIQUIDITY">
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <li className={li}>
            Every reward round automatically earmarks {fmtBp(config.burnPctBp, 0)} of its revenue
            for buyback & burn — an automated process that market-buys $HUB and destroys it forever,
            permanently shrinking what's left. The token's own on-chain supply drop is the proof —
            nothing to take on faith.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            A second burn happens immediately whenever the treasury sells a desk at a discount: half
            of that sale is burned on the spot, independent of the round-based burn above.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            The first liquidity pool ($HUB/SOL) costs the protocol nothing to launch — it's seeded
            automatically the moment a desk graduates through the OTC launch curve, and its trading
            fees flow back into the reward pool too.
          </li>
          <li className={li}>
            A second pool ($HUB/$OTC) opens once price has held steady for at least 14 days —
            deepened using treasury OTC and $HUB holdings, never a market buy. Every dollar the
            treasury puts into liquidity stays locked there; it's never sold.
